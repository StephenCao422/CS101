The British kept this codebreaking secret and successfully used it to counter Nazi assaults during the war.  (A similar process took place against the [Imperial Japanese PURPLE machine](https://infogalactic.com/info/Purple_(cipher_machine)) by the American government.)  This code breaking was heavily fictionalized in the novel *Cryptonomicon* by Neal Stephenson.\n",
